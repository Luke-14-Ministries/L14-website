// "email, first name, phone" and sends every person the same hosted invitation
// the API would, so the Social Security number is typed into Checkr's form and
// never touches us either way. At twenty to forty checks a year the course
// cost cannot be recovered in saved minutes, so the flow here is deliberately
// file-based:
//
//   1. The site works out who is due and writes Checkr's exact CSV.
//   2. A coordinator uploads that file at dashboard.checkr.com.
//   3. Checkr's results CSV comes back and the site reconciles it.
//
// Two file moves per batch, no API key to protect, no webhook to go silently
// wrong -- and the same privacy guarantee.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Reconcile Checkr's results export.
//
// Written against a REAL export (27 Aug), not a guess, and two things in that
// file would have caused real harm if this had shipped on assumptions.
//
// 1. STATUS IS NOT THE RESULT. Checkr's export has both `Status` and
//    `Assessment`. `Status` says whether the report FINISHED -- it reads
//    "complete" on every finished report, including one that came back
//    "consider". `Assessment` is the verdict. Reading Status as the result
//    would have marked a volunteer with a criminal-record hit as CLEARED, on a
//    safeguarding record, silently. So: Status decides whether we have an
//    answer yet; Assessment decides what the answer is.
//
// 2. "Candidate email" IS NOT ALWAYS THE CANDIDATE'S. In the sample export,
//    two reports for a person named Steve Wayne Gillespie both carry
//    ellen@luke14ministries.net -- the staff member who ordered them by hand.
//    Matching on email alone would have tied someone else's background check
//    to Ellen's record. Anything ordered through THIS screen carries the right
//    address (invited_email, migration 0057), so email matching is exact for
//    our own batches; older hand-ordered checks fall back to an exact
//    full-name match, and the preview says which method was used so a person
//    decides before anything is written.
// 3. CHECKR'S WORDS ARE NOT OUR WORDS. checkr_status has been a constrained
//    column since 0029 -- eight values the site chose. The real export's
//    Assessment reads "review", which is not one of them, so writing it
//    through would have failed the check constraint at the moment of import,
//    with a message about a constraint, AFTER a preview that said the row was
//    fine. So the verdict is mapped into our vocabulary here and Checkr's own
//    word is kept verbatim in `assessment` (migration 0060).
//
//    Everything that means "a person must look at this" collapses to
//    'consider'. That is not a loss: nothing about how the site behaves turns
//    on the difference between "review" and "consider", and both mean nobody
//    is cleared.

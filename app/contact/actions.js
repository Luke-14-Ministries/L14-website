// The contact form actually sends now.
//
// Until 30 August 2026 this page had no server side at all: ContactForm.jsx
// called preventDefault(), set a "submitted" flag, showed a thank-you, and
// dropped the message. Meanwhile the page around it said "please don't
// hesitate to reach out using the contact form." That was safe while only
// staff were testing and stops being safe the moment the preview link reaches
// anyone who might use it in good faith.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO: it stores nothing. There is no contact_messages
// table, and that is deliberate rather than unfinished. A message goes to the
// shared mailbox, where staff already work, where it can be replied to, filed
// and searched with the tools they already know. A table would mean a
// migration, policies, grants, an admin page nobody has a habit of opening,
// and a second place holding what the public writes to a disability ministry.
// Email is the boring option and the boring option is the rule here.

// One registration on the family dashboard, collapsible to its own title bar.
//
// A family with three registrations was scrolling past three full cards to
// reach anything below them (asked for 25 Aug). Collapsing is the fix, but a
// collapse that hides something the family needs to ACT on is worse than the
// scrolling was — the deposit banner in particular exists to be seen.
//
// So two rules govern this:
//
//   1. The title bar carries the status. Whatever is outstanding — a deposit
//      due, a balance owing — is named on the bar itself, so a collapsed card
//      still says what it wants. A bar that reads only "Camp Celebrate · 2
//      people · $960" hides the one thing that mattered.
//
//   2. Anything needing attention opens itself. `defaultOpen` is decided by
//      the server from real payment state, not by position in the list. A
//      single registration also opens, because there is nothing to tidy when
//      there is only one of them.
//
// State is deliberately NOT persisted. A remembered collapse would fight rule
// 2 — a family who collapsed a card in June would not see July's deposit ask —
// and predictable beats clever on a page about money.

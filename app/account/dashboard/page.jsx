            put My Account Settings in row 2 -- and row 2 cannot begin until the
            tall Registrations card in row 1 ends. The result was a column of
            white space under My Household and the settings card stranded most
            of a screen below it (26 Aug). items-start stops a card stretching;
            it cannot stop a row starting late.

            Each side is now its own flex column, so the right-hand cards stack
            against each other instead of against a row boundary. order-* still
            drives the donor-first swap, and now does it within a column.

            The wrappers are `contents` below lg, which removes them from
            layout entirely so all four cards are direct grid children again on
            a phone. That matters: on one narrow column the old reading order
            was Registrations, Household, Giving, Settings, and wrapping would
            have pushed Household below Giving -- demoting "your people" under
            "your money" on the screen most families will actually use. With
            display:contents the order-* classes still place all four, so the

// The support-details card, which folds itself away once every attendee has
// been reviewed.
//
// Asked for 25 Aug: a card asking for medical detail should not keep shouting
// after the job is done. But it must not disappear either — families come back
// to change a medication or an emergency contact, and a card that vanished on
// completion would send them hunting for it. So: complete means folded to one
// green line, one click from open.
//
// Anything outstanding keeps it open. The card's whole purpose is the nagging,
// and that has to survive a page load.

// emailed link did not work. Since 21 Aug 2026 there are only two ways to get
// here: the link was already used, or it expired (about an hour). The old
// third cause -- "opened in a different browser than the one that signed up"
// -- was the PKCE device-binding bug, fixed by the email templates pointing at
// /auth/confirm/, whose button verifies the token on the server. (Not by "the
// switch to the implicit flow", as this said until 29 Sep 2026; that setting
// never took effect -- see lib/supabase/client.js.) Do not resurrect that
// wording, it sends people chasing a cause that no longer exists.

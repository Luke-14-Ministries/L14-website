'use client';

// The page a visitor sees when client-side code throws. Without this file,
// Next.js shows one unstyled line -- "Application error: a client-side
// exception has occurred" -- which is exactly what a tester hit on 24 Aug
// after an ACH attempt. That crash had the signature of a deployment landing
// mid-session (a refresh fixed it), which is also why the primary button here
// is a FULL reload: it pulls the current build, which for that whole class of
// failure is the cure.
//
// Written for this site's actual audience: a parent mid-registration, not a
// developer. No stack traces, no jargon, a reassurance that their work is
// saved (writes happen server-side on save -- a rendering crash does not
// undo them), and two ways forward.

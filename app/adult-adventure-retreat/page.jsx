// The hero borrows the BANNER'S PALETTE rather than reproducing the banner at
// full bleed. Three reasons:
//
//   1. The artwork is 16:9. Full width, it fills an entire laptop viewport
//      before a single word of the page is visible — a poster, not a header.
//   2. Its words are pixels. Dates, tagline and program name set as real text
//      can be selected, searched, read by a screen reader, and corrected in
//      one line when they change. This page having the WRONG dates until
//      today is exactly what happens when the facts live only in an image.
//   3. Keeping the artwork beside the text lets both do their job: the mark
//      and the colours carry the feel, the text carries the information.
//
// Colours sampled from the banner: deep pine, the gold of the header band, the
// mid-green of the treeline.

              Days are built around real adventure in the Smokies &mdash; time outdoors,
              activities chosen for the group, and space to try things with support close
              by. Evenings are worship, food, and the kind of unhurried time together
              that turns a retreat into friendships that last past the weekend.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is designed for adults who manage their day-to-day with a degree of
              independence &mdash; and the trained buddy each participant is paired with
              is there to make the adventure bigger, not smaller.

              Registering takes a few minutes and holds your place; the medical and

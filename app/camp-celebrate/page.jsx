          <p>
            At Camp Celebrate, persons with disabilities and their families
            receive encouragement and care in the comfort of a safe family camp
            environment. Enjoy fully-accessible and age-appropriate fun
            activities, be nourished by hearty home-style meals, build lifelong
            relationships and glean from meaningful conversations from a
            network of families who understand the challenges of life with
            disability. You&rsquo;ll leave camp encouraged, refreshed, and just
            maybe a little bit tired from all the fun you and your family will
            have!
          </p>
          <p>
            Camp Celebrate is designed for anyone who has a disability and
            their families, young, old and everyone in between!
          </p>
          <p>Each and every camper is welcomed, appreciated, and celebrated!</p>
          <p>
            When you join us for a family retreat, you can expect lots of time
            to enjoy activities as a family, teaching and worship times as a
            large group, free time to spend while your children are well cared
            for, refreshing and encouraging time with other men and women who
            have walked a road similar to yours, fun, safe and age appropriate
            programs for each camper attending, and so much more!
          </p>
          <p>
            There will be a buddy assigned to your family member who has a
            disability, and they will stay with your camper almost 100% of the
            day. They will be there to help you, get to know you all and give
            your camper the best retreat experience possible! (They cannot help
            with personal needs, so you&rsquo;ll set meeting times and places
            to take care of those needs.)
          </p>
          <p>
            From the minute you arrive until the moment you drive away, you
            will be blessed.

// The old step machine is gone. What replaces it:
//   - numbered cards, each a section of the form
//   - a sticky summary bar with the running total and the submit button, so
//     "what will this cost / am I done" is always on screen
//   - validation reported against named sections instead of step numbers
//
// The DEEP support profile (medications, allergies, seizure and behaviour
// detail, emergency contact) is deliberately NOT here -- it lives in a
// per-person form the family completes after registering
// (/account/details/[personId]). Registration should take a few minutes and
// secure a place; the medical detail can follow before camp.

      {/* DEPOSIT DECISION settled 30 Sep 2026 (Lawrence): submit freely; the
          deposit is needed for approval unless a full scholarship is asked
          for. The wording below says so. Older history follows.

          This used to say "ask at camp@luke14ministries.net" -- written before
          the scholarship request existed in the site. It sent a family off to
          compose an email for something the platform now handles, and put the
          burden of asking on the person least likely to want to (26 Aug).

          The reassurance stays where it is, because THIS is the moment it is
          needed: someone looking at $495 and wondering whether to carry on.
          Only the instruction changes -- and it now says the asking happens
          after submitting, so nobody stops here believing they must sort the
          money out first.

          ⚠ REVISIT AFTER THE DEPOSIT DECISION (Decisions doc, question 9).
          This assumes today's behaviour: a registration reaches staff whether
          or not the deposit is paid. If the deposit becomes required to
          submit, this line is the FIRST place that has to say so -- a family
          reading "submit your registration, then..." and being refused at the
          button has been misled by us. The deposit paragraph in the
          confirmation email changes with it. */}
      <p className="text-center text-sm text-neutral-500 pb-2">
        Cost shouldn&rsquo;t decide this. You can submit without paying: a $50
        deposit per person is needed for approval, unless you request a full
        scholarship &mdash; use &ldquo;Request help with the fee&rdquo; on your
        dashboard after submitting. Asking does not affect anyone&rsquo;s place.

// Family registration, as ONE scrolling page rather than a four-step
// click-through (CampSite moved the same way; a family filling this in on a
// phone can see the whole shape of what is being asked, scroll back to fix
// something, and never lose answers to a mis-tapped Back button).
//
// The old step machine is gone. What replaces it:
//   - numbered cards, each a section of the form
//   - a sticky summary bar with the running total and the submit button, so
//     "what will this cost / am I done" is always on screen
//   - validation reported against named sections instead of step numbers
//   - since 26 Oct 2026, every card folds (its header is a button) and
//     carries a status chip -- "Complete ✓" or "Needs: ..." -- from the same
//     per-card rules the submit applies (sessionNeeds() ... agreementNeeds())
//
// The support profile (medications, allergies, seizure and behaviour detail,
// emergency contact) is asked HERE, per person, in card 4 -- since 16 October
// 2026 (Larry and Ellen's inked read-through, confirmed on the call). A camper
// cannot be submitted without it; everyone else gets the short version. From
// 24 Aug to 16 Oct it lived only in the per-person form on the dashboard
// (/account/details/[personId]), which stays for edits and for the photo.
// The questions themselves are components/SupportDetailsFields.jsx and the
// rule for what a camper must answer is supportProblems() in lib/support.js,
// both shared with that form.

      {/* DEPOSIT DECISION settled 30 Sep 2026 (Lawrence): submit freely; the
          deposit is needed for approval unless a full scholarship is asked
          for. The wording below says so. Older history follows.

          This used to say "ask at camp@luke14ministries.net" -- written before
          the scholarship request existed in the site. It sent a family off to
          compose an email for something the platform now handles, and put the
          burden of asking on the person least likely to want to (26 Aug).

          The reassurance stays where it is, because THIS is the moment it is
          needed: someone looking at $495 and wondering whether to carry on.
          Only the instruction changes -- and it now says the asking happens
          after submitting, so nobody stops here believing they must sort the
          money out first.

          ⚠ REVISIT AFTER THE DEPOSIT DECISION (Decisions doc, question 9).
          This assumes today's behaviour: a registration reaches staff whether
          or not the deposit is paid. If the deposit becomes required to
          submit, this line is the FIRST place that has to say so -- a family
          reading "submit your registration, then..." and being refused at the
          button has been misled by us. The deposit paragraph in the
          confirmation email changes with it. */}

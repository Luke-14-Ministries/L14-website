// Shared helpers for "which events can someone register for right now?" --
// used by the /register chooser and the family wizard so the two can never
// disagree about what's open.
//
// Two ideas live here:
//
// PROGRAM. The ministry thinks in programs (Camp Celebrate, the Retreat, the
// Party); the database stores each registrable session as its own event row
// ("Camp Celebrate 2027 — Week 1"). The program is the part of the name
// before the " — " separator, so grouping needs no schema change -- but it
// does make that em-dash separator load-bearing in event names. Name new
// events "Program Name — Session" and grouping is automatic; an event with
// no " — " is simply its own program (right for the Retreat or the Party).
//
// OPEN. An event accepts registrations when ALL of these hold:
//   - published (the master switch, admin-set on the Setup page)
//   - it has a published pricing option
//   - registration_opens_at is unset or in the past
//   - registration_closes_at is unset or in the future
// The opens/closes timestamps existed in the schema from day one; the Setup
// page is what finally lets staff set them, and this function is what makes
// every public surface honor them.

export const programOf = (name) => (name ?? '').split(' — ')[0].trim();

// STAFF-ASSIGNED vs SORTED ON ARRIVAL (decided 2 Oct 2026). Camp weeks have
// rooms, buddies and programs assigned in advance on the staff pages. A
// retreat does not: everything is sorted by hand when people arrive, so the
// Rooms, Buddies and Programs pages (and their nav badges, and the program
// leader's view) show CAMPS only. Every other type -- retreat, dinner, other --
// gets the limited set (registration, payments, check-in, medical), which is
// the safe default for anything new (Lawrence, 3 Oct 2026). Keyed on
// event_type so it is one line to change; the pages that use it must select
// `event_type`.
//
// Known next step: the Luke 14 Party/dinner may one day register here and
// want buddies but never rooms. When it does, split this into one list per
// tool rather than adding 'dinner' here, which would also give it rooms.
export const STAFF_ASSIGNED_TYPES = ['camp_week'];
export const staffAssigns = (event) => STAFF_ASSIGNED_TYPES.includes(event?.event_type);

// How each event_type reads on staff pages. The events_type check constraint
// allows these four; the New event form offers only Camp and Retreat.

  camp_week: 'Camp',
  retreat: 'Retreat',

  other: 'Other',
};

// bug the moment 0069 published a SECOND option per event — the zero-fee
// volunteer role. Whichever the array happened to yield first would have set
// the price on the chooser page and the fee written onto every participant, so
// a bad draw registers a whole family at $0.

// THE CLOCK, read in one place.
//
// Every staff page opens on "current" events: ended less than 30 days ago and
// starting within the next twelve months (agreed 25 Aug 2026). Until
// 16 September 2026 eight pages each had their own copy of that arithmetic,
// and components/EventFilter.jsx had a ninth. This is now the only one, so a
// change to either edge happens once and a page's default can never disagree
// with the pill row.
//
// A note on WHY these are functions and not inline Date.now() calls. The
// lint rule react-hooks/purity (eslint-plugin-react-hooks 7) flags a bare
// Date.now() or new Date() inside a component, because in a CLIENT component
// that re-renders, a value that moves between renders produces unstable UI.
// Every caller of these helpers is a SERVER component: it renders once per
// request, and reading the clock at request time is exactly what "today"
// means there. Routing the read through here is not a way round the rule.
// It is the one place the read belongs, and it happens to be a place the
// rule does not look. If a CLIENT component ever needs "now", it should get
// it from props (decided on the server) or from an effect, not from here.

// week is its own event, so Week 1 and Week 2 each get their own date.
//
// Camp weeks only. Retreats, dinners and other events return null, and every
// caller keeps the old "staff will be in touch about the due date" wording
// for them. To extend the rule, widen DUE_DATE_EVENT_TYPES; to change the
// lead time, change BALANCE_DUE_DAYS_BEFORE. Both are here and nowhere else.

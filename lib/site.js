// password genuinely works -- and the person lands somewhere else entirely,
// having just been taught that this flow is trustworthy. It is a phishing
// assist rather than a data breach, which is precisely why it survives review.

// This existed as the same three lines copied into four files

// and mailto: and javascript:; and anything starting with '//' or '/\', both
// of which browsers read as protocol-relative and follow off-site.
//
// Hardened 18 Oct 2026 (security audit): browsers strip tab, CR and LF from a
// URL, so "/%09/evil.com" passed the old prefix test and became "//evil.com".
// Now any control character or backslash anywhere is refused, and the result
// must parse as a path on our own origin; what is returned is that parsed path.

  // WHICH ADDRESS FOR WHAT -- decided 27 August 2026.
  //
  // info@, information@, camp@ and registration@ are all aliases on ONE
  // Microsoft 365 shared mailbox whose primary address is info@ and whose
  // display name is "Luke 14 Ministries". Every one of them lands in the same
  // inbox and reaches the same people. The choice between them is therefore
  // about what the READER should understand, never about where mail goes:
  //
  //   info          anything general -- who are you, how do I get involved,
  //                 something on the site is broken, a photo concerns me.
  //   registration  anything to do with a registration: statements, receipts,
  //                 payments, scholarships, rooms. Camp Celebrate AND the
  //                 Adult Adventure Retreat -- both register the same way.
  //   giving        donations and giving statements. NOT an alias on the
  //                 shared mailbox: it is a separate distribution group that
  //                 delivers to the giving team.
  //   camp          OUTBOUND ONLY -- newsletters and announcements to a list.
  //                 Kept deliberately (27 Aug): a newsletter is the ministry
  //                 talking to camp families as a group, which is a different
  //                 act from a family writing in about their own registration,
  //                 and it reads correctly coming from camp@. It is not
  //                 printed anywhere on the site as a contact address, and
  //                 nothing on the site sends from it.
  //
  // Outbound identity, CORRECTED 29 Aug 2026. This comment used to say Exchange
  // rewrites alias sends to the mailbox primary, so a hand-typed message always
  // left as info@ whichever alias was chosen. That WAS true when it was written
  // and is no longer: the tenant's SendFromAliasEnabled setting was turned on
  // 27 Aug and took about two days to take effect, and a test on 29 Aug arrived
  // as "Luke 14 Ministries <registration@luke14ministries.net>". Picking an
  // alias in the From dropdown now works, and the display name stays
  // "Luke 14 Ministries" either way -- which is the point: one voice, and the
  // address says which door the reply should come back through.
  // Automated mail still does not go through this mailbox at all -- Resend
  // sends it from registration@ and giving@ directly.

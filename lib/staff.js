// Reads the caller's own row from public.staff. The staff_select policy in

// Access model (from the staff table + helper functions in 0001/0010):
//   registrar   -> registrations, payments, rosters
//   coordinator -> buddy assignments, activities, rooming, program placements (0090)
//   admin       -> everything, including granting roles
//   can_view_sensitive -> support needs, medical, camper ID photos (a separate
//                         grant, not implied by role)
//   can_view_giving    -> donor giving records (a separate grant for EVERYONE,
//                         admins included -- like sensitive, it is protection
//                         for the room, not a barrier against the person).
//                         Camp payments do NOT imply giving.
// These checks MIRROR the database's row-level security; RLS is the real
// backstop, so a page that forgets a check still cannot read data it shouldn't.
//
// THE GRANTS MODEL (0100, 16 Oct 2026; lib/grants.js). Alongside the role,
// every staff member holds read/write grants on ten areas, set by presets on
// Staff & Access and logged. can(staff, 'read:payments') and
// can(staff, 'write:buddies') read them. The role checks above still decide
// what the database allows until the rules switch over area by area (plan
// step 3); the two coexist on purpose, and nothing reads a grant for
// enforcement yet.

// PROGRAM LEADER: the layout admits leaders (migration 0061), the page then
// throws them to /account/, /account/ sees a signed-in person and sends them
// back to ?next=, and the browser gives up with ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS. Found
// by Testing Script 3 §6.2/§7.1: a leader who typed /admin got an error page
// instead of their own roster. No staff content leaked; it was a loop, not a
// hole. A leader now lands on My Program; everyone else still goes to log in.

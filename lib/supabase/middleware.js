// Session refresh, and the gate on signed-in pages.
//
// A Supabase session is a short-lived access token plus a long-lived refresh
// token, both kept in cookies. The access token expires after an hour. Nothing
// in the browser can refresh a cookie that a server-rendered page is about to
// read -- by the time the page renders, the request is already in flight. So
// the refresh happens here, in middleware, before any page runs.
//
// Skip this and everything works for about an hour, then people start getting
// logged out mid-form with no error message and no pattern anyone can repeat.
// That is the bug this file exists to prevent.
//
// It does two other jobs. It keeps anonymous visitors out of the signed-in
// area -- a convenience, not the security boundary; row-level security in the
// database is the real one. And it enforces the SECOND half of two-factor
// login, which is a real boundary and has to live here; see the aal check
// below for why.

// Anything under one of these prefixes requires a logged-in user.
// /account/reset-password is here because arriving from a password-reset email
// puts a real session in place first -- so someone who followed the link gets
// straight in, and someone who typed the URL from memory gets the login screen
// instead of a form that cannot work. /account/security is a signed-in page
// too. /admin has its own role checks in the layout, but belongs here as well
// so the two-factor rule below covers it.

  // logged in?" would let it straight in. That was a live bug, found by a

  // passed the code this time (currentLevel aal1) may not enter a protected
  // page -- UNLESS this browser holds a valid trusted-device token, because
  // "remember this browser for 30 days" works precisely by skipping the code
  // and therefore legitimately lives at aal1. The token's hash is checked
  // against mfa_trusted_devices server-side; RLS scopes that read to the
  // signed-in user's own rows, so one user's cookie cannot vouch for another.

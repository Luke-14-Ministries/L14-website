// Two kinds of page header, because the ministry has two kinds of image.
//
//   photo (default) — a PHOTOGRAPH used as a background. Cropped to fill,
//                     darkened, with the page title set over it. Cropping a
//                     photo is fine: there is no wrong part to lose.
//
//   banner          — a DESIGNED GRAPHIC that already contains its own title,
//                     dates and location as pixels. Cropping one of these cuts
//                     the words off, which is exactly what was happening on
//                     the Adult Adventure Retreat page: a 16:9 artwork forced
//                     into a 3.4:1 band showed only the middle, losing "CAMP
//                     CELEBRATE" along the top and the dates along the bottom.
//                     A banner is rendered at its own aspect ratio, full
//                     width, with no dark overlay and no second title printed
//                     over the one already in the artwork.
//
// The title is still passed for a banner and still rendered — as screen
// reader-only text. Otherwise those words exist only as pixels, which is no
// use to someone using a screen reader and no use to a search engine either.

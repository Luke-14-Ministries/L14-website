# CLAUDE.md — Luke 14 Ministries website & registration platform

*Reviewed for drift 2 September 2026 — every statement below was checked against the repository, the database ledger and the vendor consoles that day. Anything found wrong was corrected in place and dated.*

Read this before touching anything. It is the standing brief for any Claude session working in
this repository, and it outranks assumptions carried in from other Next.js projects.

## What this project is

Luke 14 Ministries is a disability ministry in Morristown, Tennessee — a registered 501(c)(3).
This repository is the ministry's public website **and**, from Phase 1 onward, its own camp
registration platform.

The reason the platform is being built rather than bought: Campsite costs the ministry roughly
**7.4% all-in** — a 6% transaction rate *plus* a flat platform fee of about $249/month, and on the
ministry's volume the fixed half is the larger half. Replacing that is the entire financial case.
The 6%-only figure quoted in older documents is retired; see `DECISIONS.md`, 2026-08-05. Vendors are
used only where they carry real risk we should not: payments (Stripe), database and auth
(Supabase), hosting (Vercel), DNS and edge protection (Cloudflare), identity and documents
(Microsoft 365).

Two constraints shape every decision:

1. **A volunteer built this, and a volunteer has to be able to maintain it.** Prefer the boring,
   well-documented option over the clever one. Explain *why* in comments and in `DECISIONS.md`.
2. **It must be live before next camp season's registration opens**, and the maintainer's
   availability drops sharply once the academic semester starts. Front-load. Do not start
   architectural rewrites in October.

The full reasoning lives in `IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` (SharePoint, `01 Plans and Decisions\md files`).
The working checklist is `DO-THIS-NEXT.md` (SharePoint, `02 Accounts and Setup\md files`).

## Where things stand — 31 August 2026

**The database is live.** Migration `0001_core_schema.sql` has been run against the Supabase
project `luke14-prod` (ref `nnbcxqxwkivadzognpno`). Queried directly on 31 August 2026 rather
than remembered, the live schema holds **47 base tables, 5 views and 108 row-level-security
policies**, with **RLS enabled on all 47 of the 47 tables** and 41 functions in `public`.
Self-check passed.
`supabase/migrations/rls_test.sql` is the harness — it seeds **six personas** (two families, three
staff at different access levels, and the camp doctor) plus an unauthenticated visitor, runs **41
assertions** against them and reports `ALL CHECKS PASSED` against real Postgres. **Never edit 0001; it has been run.** New work
goes in `0002_*.sql`.

**Authentication works end to end**, proven against the live database: sign-up → confirmation email
→ callback → session → dashboard rendering the person's own name out of `public.profiles`, with
`handle_new_user()` creating that row automatically. Login, logout and password reset are wired.

**Emailed links work from any device, and survive mail scanners — the button page is the fix**
*(corrected 29 September 2026; this paragraph called the template switch an open task for weeks
after it was done)*. Sign-up and password-reset emails point at `/auth/confirm/?token_hash=…`, a
page with one button; pressing it verifies the token on the server with `verifyOtp()`. Scanners
such as Outlook SafeLinks only fetch the page, so the one-time token is still unspent when the
person arrives, and verifying needs no code verifier, so a link requested on a laptop works on a
phone. The templates were checked from a real reset email on 29 September; their wording is in
`supabase/EMAIL-TEMPLATE-SNIPPETS.md`, and editing them is allowed because auth email sends through
Resend from `registration@luke14ministries.net`. The tokens still start with `pkce_` — `@supabase/ssr`
forces PKCE in the browser client whatever it is told, so the `flowType: 'implicit'` that
`lib/supabase/client.js` carried from 21 August never took effect and was removed. **Protect the
templates, not a flow setting:** pointed back at `/auth/callback` with `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}`,
the links become `?code=` links tied to one browser again. `DECISIONS.md`, 2026-09-29.

**Update, 26 August 2026 — the platform is built and in staff testing.** Migrations now run
through `0061` (never edit a migration that has been run; new work goes in the next number).
Checked on 30 August against the live ledger: the repository and production agree, with no
applied migration missing from `supabase/migrations/`. Two caveats about that ledger, so nobody
reads drift into it. It begins at `0012` — `0001`–`0011` were applied before the CLI ledger was
in use. And four repository files were applied as more than one entry each (`0023`, `0028`,
`0032`, and `0059`, whose second half is recorded as `all_screening_verdicts`), so the ledger
carries 54 rows for 50 files. Both are expected; neither is a missing migration. *Checked again 1 September: 66 rows. `0070` is a fifth multi-entry file — the ledger holds `multi_week_discount` (the first draft, whose row-pick used a tuple `max()` that Postgres does not have) and `multi_week_discount_fix_pick` (the corrected function). The repository's `0070` already carries the corrected text, so there is no drift — an earlier note today said there was, before the file was compared to both ledger rows. `0071` (`program_leader_is_lead`) and `0072` (`program_leaders_for`) were applied through the Supabase MCP on 1 September, so their ledger names match their files for once.* Working end
to end in Stripe test mode: family accounts and household management (per-adult phones, linked
caregivers), the registration wizard with true edit/update mode and tracked changes (staff review
queue at /admin/changes; role changes on a confirmed person auto-flip to re-review), card + bank
payments with receipts (then from camp@; since 27 August from `registration@`), scholarships/discounts with a credit display ("Credit −$X"),
printable statements (staff at /admin/registrations/[id]/statement, family at
/account/statement/[id], donors at /admin/giving/statements — all on ministry letterhead), the
staff admin (rosters, check-in, dietary + no-names kitchen list, medical, Event Payments with a
90-day event scope + filtered CSVs, Giving, Staff & Access), and Resend newsletters (trial sent;
click-tracking domain verified).

**Working rules learned the hard way:** every new table needs explicit role grants alongside its
RLS policies (RLS without `grant ... to authenticated` = permission denied); never swallow query
errors in admin pages; `/account/*` "my data" queries must scope by household membership
explicitly, never rely on RLS alone (staff RLS is broad); PostgREST nested joins with two FKs to
the same table are fragile — use separate simple lookups. **Never define a component inside
another component's body** — it becomes a new type on every render and React remounts it,
which silently emptied the staff table's job-title boxes until 16 September 2026; hoist it to
module level and pass what it needs as props.

**Done since that update:** the volunteer application (17 Aug); Turnstile on the public account
forms (live on sign-up, login and password reset); and refunds end to end — `charge.refunded`
handled by `supabase/functions/stripe-refund-webhook/`, per-family refunds through `refundPayment`
in `app/admin/registrations/[id]/actions.js`, with the over-refund guard and the pending-refund
accounting in migrations `0038`/`0044`/`0053`/`0054`.

**Built since, 27–29 August — six migrations the paragraph above predates.** Background screening
stopped being a placeholder (`0056`–`0060`): `person_clearances`, screening batches, background
checks as their own staff permission with every grant recorded in an audit log, the result detail
learned from a real Checkr export, and a translation layer between Checkr's vocabulary and ours.
Then `0061`, which is the one to read before touching access control — see the next section.

**Built 31 August — migrations `0062`–`0070`; `0071` and `0072` followed on 1 September (the program-lead flag, and the definer function that lets co-leaders see each other's names), and the high-water mark is now `0072`.** Volunteers
affirm the Apostles' Creed on the volunteer application (`0062`, `0063`). Allergies carry a
severity, in the only three terms that change what somebody does (`0064`). Program leaders got
their table comment corrected — a second, assistant leader always worked (`0065`). Every camper is
treated as needing a one-to-one buddy until a coordinator says otherwise, which needed a tri-state
because "nobody decided" and "decided no" had been the same value (`0066`). Rooming preferences and
likes/dislikes are collected (`0067`), and `0068` put those and `allergy_severity` into the change
log — **adding a column to `person_support` is not finished until `log_family_change()` is
redefined**, which `0064` missed and is the trap to remember.

`0069` and `0070` are the two to read before touching money. `0069` publishes a **second, zero-fee
`event_option` per event** so one person can hold two roles at one camp (a parent who also
volunteers, charged once). That broke an assumption four files were making —
`event_options.find((o) => o.published)` — which became a money bug the moment an event had two
options, because a bad draw returns the zero-fee one and sets the price. Use `enrollmentOption()`
in `lib/events.js`; never "the first published option". `0070` adds
`recalc_multi_week_discount()`, which applies the both-weeks discount as a **rule recomputed from
stored facts** rather than something the wizard works out, and which **only ever touches discounts
carrying its own `discount_reason`** — a manual staff discount is invisible to it. Whether
volunteering must cover both weeks or just one is still with staff; the rule is three named
constants at the top of that function.

**Next, in order:**

1. **Purge ALL test data** from the production project. Everything after this depends on it.
2. **Live Stripe keys**, and **both** live-mode webhooks — `stripe-webhook` *and*
   `stripe-refund-webhook`. Test-mode endpoints do not carry over; a missed refund webhook fails
   silently (see migration `0054`).
3. **Vercel Pro.** Required the moment live keys are in — Hobby is non-commercial only. See the
   Hosting note below.
4. ~~**Spam protection on the contact and newsletter forms.**~~ **Half done, half moot** *(corrected
   1 Sep)*: the contact form got Turnstile with server-side verification on 30 August
   (`app/contact/actions.js`, `lib/turnstile.js`); the newsletter page only links out to a Google
   Form, so there is nothing to protect. What remains is a *design* question — replace that link
   with an on-site sign-up that writes to Resend contacts, or keep the Google Form.

**Done 1 September, from Lawrence's read of Testing Script 3:** buddy pills now say *buddy
assigned — name*, *no buddy assigned* and *buddy not needed* (the words camp uses); a program can
have one **lead** among its leaders (`0071` + `0072`, a label not a permission, shown on Programs and at the
top of My Program); and the registration wizard says "family or group" so a group home or church
group is not told it is in the wrong place (the data model always allowed it — a household needs no
family relationship and a person can carry their own address).

**Done 8 September:** the two-factor page (`app/account/security/SecurityManager.jsx`) steps the
session up before adding or removing a device. Supabase requires AAL2 for both, and a browser
remembered at login sits at AAL1, so both buttons used to fail with Supabase's raw "AAL2 required"
text — found by Lawrence while moving codes into Bitwarden. The page now asks for a current code
inline and then continues. Testing Script 3, item 20.10.
5. **The balance-reminder buttons in `app/admin/payments/page.jsx`** are still `disabled`
   placeholders — "Email balance reminders (all shown)" and "Email selected families" render but
   do nothing.

**14 October 2026 — Script 4 run by bots; the review queue; migrations through `0085`.** Testing
Script 4 was run by three automated testers against the deployed commit (notes in SharePoint,
*Testing notes*): five defects, all fixed the same day. Then, from Lawrence's reading of Ellen and
Katie's feedback: the review queue is its own page (`app/admin/review/`) and Event Payments shows
money flags only; the person page carries review state, agreements, application and permissions
per event; Buddy Assignments hides paired volunteers by default and has a CSV and one printable
sheet per buddy; `app/admin/newsletter/` lists who has news on (`0085`); only campers choose
activities; the support form requires the answers that decide what staff do and no longer asks
non-campers the disability questions; a building with rooms refuses placements; the retreat page
sends 2026 registrants to CampSite. The sidebar order is an explicit list in `layout.jsx`.
`0084` makes the first save of support details reach Recent Changes. **Evening, the same day:**
one role per person per event (`0086`, superseding `0069`'s parent-who-volunteers: the wizard no
longer offers it, the database refuses it); outside-provider waivers need an uploaded confirmation
from the family and from each volunteer (`0087`, private bucket `waiver-confirmations`); the
Creed agreement is at version 3 (`0088`, "contact Larry" said once); the sidebar is in sections
(one `SECTIONS` list in `layout.jsx`); `/admin/search` and a header search box; Volunteers by
event with `/admin/volunteers/print`. **Testing Script 5 is written** (SharePoint, `01 Plans and
Decisions`) and is the current script; Script 4 is archived. Python 3.12 is installed on the build
machine, so the library's `render.py` runs here.

**15 October 2026 — the review decision, and `0089`.** A registration's page opens with the
family (name, people as links to their person pages, every event the household is registered
for), then the event, then an explained money block, then a **Review** card that approves or
waitlists everyone still submitted in one click or sends the registration back to the family
for more information. That last one is `0089`: two columns on `registrations`
(`awaiting_family_since`, `awaiting_family_reason`), guarded by a trigger so only a registrar
moves them. The review queue separates *waiting on staff* from *waiting on the family*, the nav
badge counts only the first, and the family's dashboard shows the ask in amber. **Placing people
into programs is coordination** (`0090`): the Programs page and its writes need coordinator or
administrator, through `place_in_program()`, a definer function that touches only `program_id`
-- the participants table's UPDATE policy stays the registrar's. Naming a leader stays
administrator-only, now in the database as well as the app. **Background checks carry a
verdict** (`0091`): `person_clearances.verdict` is the ministry's word (`ok`, `follow_up`,
`not_permitted`), set from the volunteer's record by a holder of the Background-checks grant;
who and when are stamped by trigger, the check date is required once paperwork is on file, the
expiry follows from it by `clearance_interval_months()` (36), and every change lands in
`clearance_review_log`. The `clearance_status` view (definer, like `program_roster`) gives every
staff member the three facts — on file, current, verdict — and `clearancePill()` in
`lib/format.js` is the one way they are shown. The `volunteer_clearances` compatibility view
from `0056` is no longer read by the app. Staff idle logout is 60 minutes (was 15). The
high-water mark is `0091`. **Also that day: `/admin/search` had returned "Nothing matches" for every query
since it shipped** — `people → households` has two paths since `0037` (`people.household_id`
and `households.primary_contact_person_id`), PostgREST refused the embed with PGRST201, and the
page swallowed the error. Name the key (`households!people_household_id_fkey`) on every
people↔households embed, and never turn a query error into an empty list.

**Built 30 September 2026 — migration `0080`, payment plans (read before touching money).** A
camp week's balance is due two weeks before it starts (`balanceDueOn()` in `lib/events.js`
and `balance_due_on()` in SQL: change both together). A camp-week registration is **not
finished** until the family pays in full, sets up an automatic payment plan, or requests a
scholarship (`registration_payment_routes` view; `/account/finish/[registrationId]`). The early-
registration discount lives in its own column, `early_discount_cents`, written only by
`recalc_early_registration_discount()`. Plans are created only by `stripe-plans-webhook`, and
families can read them but not write them. The daily `charge-payment-plans` function charges
what falls due, sharing its logic with the webhook through `supabase/functions/_shared/`.
`0080` also stops families editing money columns on `registration_participants`, which they
could do before. Switch-on steps are in `supabase/PAYMENT-PLANS-SETUP.md`; tests are in
`supabase/tests/`. Not live until those steps are done.

**Built 30 September 2026, later — migration `0081`, Lawrence's answers to the staff
questions.** Read `DECISIONS.md` (same date) before touching registration or money.
- **"Not finished" is switched off.** A family submits with nothing paid.
  `requiresPaymentChoice()` in `lib/plans.js` returns `false`, and every banner, pill and
  column keys off it. Plans and pay-in-full stay on offer at `/account/finish/`, now titled
  "Ways to pay".
- **The deposit is needed for staff approval**, unless the family requests a full scholarship.
  Staff work from three classes in the `registration_review` view: deposit received
  (`succeeded` money only), full scholarship requested, or neither. The view also carries flags:
  deposit short, photo permission declined, Creed not affirmed. The classes and flags show on
  Event Payments and on each registration.
- **Three automatic discounts stack**, each in its own column and each capped at what the
  person still owes:
  - both weeks, `discount_cents` (`0070`);
  - early registration, `early_discount_cents` (`0080`);
  - family, `family_discount_cents` (`0081`). The 3rd and later person on a registration gets
    $50 off, written only by `recalc_family_discount()`. Run it before the early recalc
    (`recalcEarly()` does both).
- **Agreements are signed per person.**
  - One `agreement_signatures` row per person per agreement, with `signer_role` set to `self`,
    `parent_guardian`, `legal_guardian` or `authorized_adult`. The last needs the signer's
    explicit affirmation.
  - The rows are written by `app/register/family/actions.js`, not the RPC. People added later
    are signed for then. Old household-wide rows still cover whoever was on the registration
    when they were signed.
  - Version 2 agreements contain `{{event}}`, filled in by `agreementText()` in
    `lib/events.js`.
  - The scholarship and payment-by-check agreements are retired.
- **Volunteers arrive a day early** for orientation: `events.volunteer_arrives_on`.
- **Families can ask for their data to be deleted** at `/account/delete-data`. Staff work the
  queue at `/admin/deletion-requests`; nothing is deleted automatically.
- Tests: `supabase/tests/staff_answers_rules.sql`, run on a scratch database like the 0080 ones.

### Program leaders are not staff — a second kind of person now reaches `/admin`

Added 29 August in migration `0061`, and easy to miss: a **program leader** has **no row in
`staff`**, no role, and none of the permissions in `lib/staff.js`. Reading that file alone would
tell you they do not exist. What they have is a grant in `program_leaders` naming one program at
one event, and the only thing it buys is the right to read the `program_roster` **view**, filtered
to that program.

Three things follow, and all three are deliberate:

- **The view is the permission.** `program_roster` carries names, ages, a buddy, and *flags* for
  allergies and support needs — never the narrative columns. `0061` deliberately adds **no** policy
  to `registration_participants`, `people` or `person_support`: an earlier draft did, and it was
  removed, because a leader who can select the participant row can select every column on it.
- **`program_roster` is a `SECURITY DEFINER` view, and that is intended.** It has to be, since a
  leader holds no read on the tables underneath. It is safe because the view's own
  `where public.is_staff() or public.leads_program(...)` is the row filter. Supabase's advisor
  reports this as its one ERROR-level finding; the entry accepting it is in `DECISIONS.md`,
  30 August. Do not "fix" it by switching it to `SECURITY INVOKER` — that silently empties every
  leader's roster.
- **Leaders are held to the two-factor rule too**, in `app/admin/layout.jsx`. That is a decision,
  not an oversight: what they see is a list of disabled children's first names.

**Still mock:** the newsletter page links out to a Google Form. **The contact form is no longer
mock** — it sends through Resend to `info@` with Turnstile on it (30 August), which retires both
the "still mock" line and half of item 4 in the list above.

## Stack

Next.js 16 (App Router, JavaScript — not TypeScript; upgraded from 15 on 16 September 2026, see
`DECISIONS.md`), Tailwind CSS, deployed on Vercel. Supabase (Postgres + Auth) from Phase 1. Stripe
from Phase 2. The request-time hook at the repository root is `proxy.js` — Next 16's name for what
was `middleware.js`; older comments that say "the middleware" mean that file.

`app/` holds routes, `components/` shared UI, `lib/` helpers, `public/` static assets.

---

## Blocking facts — read these before writing code

### `output: 'export'` is gone — do not put it back (done 5 August 2026)

`next.config.mjs` now carries `trailingSlash: true` and nothing else. `output: 'export'`,
`basePath` and `images: { unoptimized: true }` were removed together in commit `eaef8d5`, the
opening commit of the Phase 1 sprint.

`output: 'export'` compiles the site to flat HTML and disables **all** server code — no API
routes, no server actions, no database calls, no Stripe. It blocked every item in Phase 1. The
other two were GitHub Pages accommodations: `basePath` served the site from a subfolder, and a
static export cannot run Next's image optimiser.

`trailingSlash: true` **stays.** It is a URL preference, not a hosting accommodation — removing
it turns `/about/` into `/about` across every link in the site.

Anything in older documentation calling this site a "static export" is out of date.

### GitHub Pages is retired — do not revive it (done 5 August 2026)

Hosting is Vercel, and only Vercel. On 5 August, in order: Pages was unpublished in repository
Settings, `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` was deleted (commit `8ea87ce`), the leftover
`github-pages` environment was removed, and the repository was renamed from
`luke-14-ministries.github.io` to **`website`**. That old name was not decorative — a repository
named `<org>.github.io` is what *tells* GitHub to serve it as the organization's Pages site.

The `Production` environment that remains under Settings → Environments belongs to **Vercel**,
which creates it through the deployments API. Leave it alone.

**`.github/workflows/build.yml` exists again from 30 August 2026, and it is NOT a deploy
workflow.** It runs `npm ci`, `npm run lint` and `npm run build` on every push to `main`, and
publishes nothing anywhere. Vercel still does all deploying, through its GitHub integration and
not through any file in this repository. The distinction matters because the last workflow file
here *was* a Pages deployer, so a future reader finding `.github/workflows/` again could
reasonably assume Pages had crept back. It has not. If that file ever grows a step that uploads,
publishes or deploys, something has gone wrong.

The repository is `https://github.com/luke-14-ministries/website.git`. GitHub redirects the old
URL, so an out-of-date clone still works, but new instructions should use the new name.

`lib/site.js` still exports an `asset()` helper that prefixes paths with
`NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH`. That variable is unset on Vercel, so it returns paths unchanged; it is
used in 16 files and was deliberately left in place rather than risk a typo across all of them
for no functional gain. Known dead weight, not a bug to fix urgently.

### `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` must stay **unset** on Vercel

It exists so a site can be served from a subfolder, which GitHub Pages needed and Vercel does
not. Setting it on Vercel breaks every
link and every image, and it fails in a way that looks like a CSS problem rather than a config
problem — which is how it eats an afternoon. Leave it out of the Vercel environment variables
entirely.

### The site is deliberately hidden from search engines — do not "fix" this

**Four** switches, all intentional while this is a preview:

- `public/robots.txt` — `Disallow: /`
- `app/layout.jsx` — `robots: { index: false, follow: false }`
- `app/layout.jsx` — the title suffix `"(Preview Build)"`
- `components/PreviewBanner.jsx` — the red PREVIEW banner

**All four are reversed together in Phase 4, at launch, and only with board approval.** Reversing
any of them early publishes a mock-up as if it were the real site. Forgetting one at launch fails
*silently* — the site simply never appears in search results and nobody notices for months. Treat
it as a single four-part checklist item.

---

### What is actually in DNS today *(verified 7 August 2026)*

Queried directly rather than assumed. `luke14ministries.net`:

- **Nameservers** are `ns01`–`ns04.squarespacedns.com` (running on NS1). The public site's A records
  are Squarespace's. **The existing site is Squarespace, not WordPress** — several older documents
  say otherwise and are wrong.
- **The registrar is therefore almost certainly Squarespace.** Nameservers prove who runs DNS rather
  than who holds the registration, so confirm it inside the Squarespace account before relying on it.
- **Mail is Microsoft 365** — MX points at `luke14ministries-net.mail.protection.outlook.com`, and a
  `MS=` verification token is present.
- **SPF is `v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all`.** Note the `-all`: that is a *hard*
  fail, so any sender not listed is rejected outright. Adding a new sender (Resend) means editing
  this exact line, and an error here silently breaks every staff email the ministry sends. Change it
  carefully, with someone watching, and never as the last task of a session.
- **DMARC exists but does nothing**: `v=DMARC1; p=none`, with no `rua=` reporting address, so nobody
  is being told who sends as the ministry.
- **No Mailchimp, no other bulk sender is authorised on this domain.** The newsletter is therefore
  going out either through Squarespace's own campaigns or from a vendor's from-address.

---

## Security rules — non-negotiable

These are the ministry's rules, agreed at board level. Do not relax them for convenience.

- **No secret ever enters this repository, OneDrive, or SharePoint.** Not in a commit, not in a
  comment, not "temporarily." Keys live in Vercel's environment variables plus the shared
  password vault. `.env.local` is gitignored; `.env.example` is the committed template and
  contains names only, never values.
- **Test keys only until launch.** Fake money, throwaway data. Live Stripe keys appear once, at
  go-live, and only in Vercel's environment settings.
- **The Supabase `service_role` / secret key bypasses row-level security entirely.** It never
  goes in the browser, in this repository, in SharePoint, or in a chat transcript. Server-side
  only, from an environment variable, and only where genuinely required.
- **Row-level security is enforced at the database level**, not in application code. Every table
  holding family data gets RLS policies. A query that works because the app "wouldn't ask for
  that row" is not secured.
- **No real family data in the preview.** It is a mock-up, and mock-ups leak.
- **No Social Security number, and no report content, ever enters this system.** That is the
  principle, and it holds. What is actually stored has grown: alongside
  `background_check_on_file`, `background_check_date` and `expires_on`, migration `0029` added a
  `volunteer_clearances` table with Checkr integration columns — `provider`,
  `checkr_candidate_id`, `checkr_invitation_id`, `checkr_report_id`, `checkr_package`,
  `checkr_status`, `adjudication`, `invitation_sent_at`, `report_completed_at`, `last_synced_at`.
  These are identifiers, a status and timestamps: pointers into Checkr, never the screening data
  itself. Checkr's **hosted invitation** flow is what keeps it that way — the volunteer types
  their SSN and date of birth into Checkr's own form, and we receive only pass/fail. It cannot
  leak from us because we never have it. **`0029` was a placeholder and no longer is** — corrected
  30 August, having said "nothing writes them yet" for four days after it stopped being true.
  `0056`–`0060` built the flow out and `app/admin/volunteers/screening/actions.js` writes
  `person_clearances` today: `provider`, `checkr_status`, `checkr_report_id`,
  `checkr_candidate_id`, `checkr_package`, and a `screening_results` jsonb holding one verdict
  WORD per screening. The guarantee is unchanged and is the reason the file-based flow was chosen
  over the API — verdict words and pointers, never report content, and no SSN at any point. The
  underlying paperwork still lives in a
  permission-restricted SharePoint folder. Never in email, never in the app. A future flow that
  would collect PII into this table is a board decision, not a pull request.
- **Never paste a key, token, or camper's personal information into a Claude conversation.** A
  secret that appears in a transcript is compromised and must be rotated.
- **Two-factor authentication on every account** — GitHub, Vercel, Supabase, Stripe, Microsoft.
  Prefer authenticator-app (TOTP) over passkeys on shared ministry accounts: a passkey is bound
  to one device and cannot be shared between two admins; a TOTP seed can live in the vault.

## Working rules

- **Never let OneDrive or SharePoint sync this repository.** It corrupts `.git`. The working copy
  lives at `C:\dev\luke14` for exactly this reason. Documents go to SharePoint; code does not.
- **Ownership is the ministry's, not a person's.** Production accounts are created under
  `admin@luke14ministries.net`. Never bind a ministry account to a personal GitHub login, and
  never add `admin@` as a verified email on a personal GitHub account.
- **Do not point the domain.** `luke14ministries.net` serves the ministry's existing **Squarespace**
  site. Pointing it retires that site, which is a board decision, not a technical step. Phase 4.
  (Older documents call this a WordPress site. That was wrong — see the DNS facts below.)
- **Record decisions in `DECISIONS.md`** — one short entry per real choice, written when the
  choice is made. In six months it is the only record of why anything is the way it is.
- **Check this file's numbers before trusting them, and correct them when they are wrong.**
  It has now drifted twice: eight ways over nineteen days to 26 August, then four more ways in
  the four days after it was corrected. The pattern is specific and worth naming — the documents
  that are *regenerated* show no drift at all, and the one that is *edited by hand* drifts every
  time. Two commands settle most of it in ten seconds, and a session that is about to rely on a
  number here should run them rather than quote the paragraph:

  ```powershell
  (Get-ChildItem supabase\migrations -Filter '0*.sql').Name | Select-Object -Last 2  # the real high-water mark
  git log -1 --date=short --format=%ad                                              # how old "where things stand" actually is
  ```

  The filter matters: the folder also holds `README.md` and `rls_test.sql`, and both sort after every
  numbered file (digits collate before letters), so an unfiltered listing's last two entries are
  always those two housekeeping files, never the actual high-water mark.

  A claim about what is *built* is the one that cannot be checked this way and goes stale
  hardest — "nothing writes them yet" was true when written and false four days later. When you
  find one wrong, fix it in the same session; leaving it is how the next reader inherits it as
  fact.
- **Commit in small, described steps.** The commit log is documentation for a future volunteer.
- **Ask before adding a dependency.** Every package is something someone has to keep updated.
- Commit identity is the ministry account, not a personal address. Check `git config user.email`
  if commits start showing up attributed oddly.

## Phase roadmap (short form)

- **Phase 0 — now.** Accounts, ownership, vault, register, governance. Mostly not code.
- **Phase 1 — August sprint. Complete.** Removing `output: 'export'` (5 August), the Supabase
  schema with RLS, family sign-up and login, the registration wizard writing to real storage, and
  Stripe end to end in **test mode** with fake money — all shipped. See "Where things stand"
  above, which is the authoritative account.
- **Phase 2. Complete, and well past the original scope.** Rosters, payment status and the
  background-check flag were the ask. Delivered instead: the full staff admin (rosters, check-in,
  dietary and kitchen lists, medical, Event Payments with filtered CSVs, Giving, Staff & Access),
  the change-review queue, scholarships and discounts, printable statements on letterhead,
  refunds, cancellation requests, lodging assignments, activities with capacity guards, the
  volunteer application, and Resend newsletters.
- **Phase 3.** Review by real people on the preview URL. Still test keys, still no real families.
- **Phase 4 — launch.** Vercel Pro, live Stripe keys, domain pointed, and all four preview
  switches reversed together. Board approval gates this phase.

Sections 5 and 9 of `IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` describe Phase 1 in full.

## Hosting note

Vercel's free **Hobby** plan is the right plan for building, and it is legitimate for Phases 1–3.
It is **not** legitimate at launch: Hobby is non-commercial only, and Vercel's fair-use terms
count "any method of requesting or processing payment from visitors of the site," adding
explicitly that asking for donations counts too. Being a 501(c)(3) does not change it — the test
is what the site *does*. Hobby is also a single seat, which conflicts with the two-admins-on-
everything rule. **Pro ($20/developer seat/month, viewer seats free) becomes necessary the moment
Stripe switches to live keys.** Plan §8 has the full reasoning.

## Where the documentation lives

- `GLOSSARY.md` — **the words this project uses, in plain English, for people who are not
  developers**, and the vocabulary to use when explaining anything to them (lint, push, branch,
  migration, grant, drift, and this project's own terms). When a non-technical team member asks
  what a word means, answer in its terms and point them at `Luke14-Glossary.pdf` at the library
  root. SharePoint, `md files`. Added 2 September 2026.
- `IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` — why, and the full phase plan. SharePoint, `01 Plans and Decisions\md files`.
- `DO-THIS-NEXT.md` — the ordered working checklist. SharePoint, `02 Accounts and Setup\md files`.
- `Luke14-Account-Register.xlsx` — every account, who owns it, who the second admin is. No
  passwords, ever. SharePoint, `02 Accounts and Setup`.
- Web-admin handbook — SharePoint, for the second admin.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — repository conventions.
- `DECISIONS.md` — the running decision log.

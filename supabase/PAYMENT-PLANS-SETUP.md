# Payment plans and the early-registration discount: switching them on

Built 30 September 2026 from Larry's rules. The site needs these steps before any of it
works. Everything stays in **Stripe test mode**. Do the Stripe steps again with live keys
at launch: test and live mode have separate webhooks and separate secrets.

## What families will see (camp weeks only)

- After registering, a **"choose how to pay"** step offering three options. (Since `0081` it is
  offered, not required: submitting needs nothing paid, and approval waits on the deposit.)
  - **Pay in full.**
  - **Payment plan:** the deposit now, then automatic charges monthly or twice a month
    until the due date (the event's `balance_due_on` — July 1 for the camp weeks, `0096`).
  - **Request a scholarship.**
- **Early registration:** $X off per person for anyone registered by the early date,
  once the family pays in full or starts a plan. A scholarship request alone does not
  earn it.
- On the dashboard, the plan's schedule and a **"Change card or bank account"** button.

Staff see a **"Paying by"** column on Event Payments, with **Not finished** in amber. Each
registration page shows the plan's schedule, with pause, resume, retry and cancel. Staff
also decide whether a family keeps the early discount when a plan fails or is cancelled.

## Switch it on: seven steps

1. **Run migration `0080_payment_plans_and_early_registration.sql`** in the Supabase SQL
   Editor, the usual way (`migrations/README.md`).
2. **Deploy the functions.** `_shared/` goes up with them automatically.
   ```
   supabase functions deploy stripe-webhook --no-verify-jwt
   supabase functions deploy stripe-plans-webhook --no-verify-jwt
   supabase functions deploy charge-payment-plans --no-verify-jwt
   ```
   `--no-verify-jwt` is correct for all three. Stripe and the timer do not send a Supabase
   login; each function checks its own signature or secret.
3. **Stripe (test mode): Developers → Webhooks → Add endpoint.**
   URL: `https://nnbcxqxwkivadzognpno.supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-plans-webhook`
   Events: `checkout.session.completed`, `checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded`,
   `checkout.session.async_payment_failed`, `payment_intent.succeeded`,
   `payment_intent.payment_failed`.
   Leave the existing `stripe-webhook` endpoint exactly as it is.
4. **Supabase → Edge Functions → Secrets**, add:
   - `STRIPE_PLANS_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: the `whsec_…` signing secret from step 3.
   - `CRON_SECRET`: a long random string. Generate it in Bitwarden and keep it there.
   - `STAFF_ALERT_TO` *(optional)*: where failed-plan alerts go. The default is
     `registration@luke14ministries.net`.
5. **Supabase → Integrations → Cron → Create job**, to run the charger once a day:
   - Schedule: `45 10 * * *` (10:45 UTC, which is 6:45am Eastern in summer and 5:45am
     in winter).
   - Type: Supabase Edge Function, `charge-payment-plans`, method POST.
   - Header: `x-cron-secret` = the `CRON_SECRET` value.
6. **Setup page → each Camp Celebrate week → "Edit dates, capacity, price and early
   registration"**: set **Early registration ends** and **Early discount** ($50).
7. **Try it** with the test script below.

## Test script (test mode)

Stripe test card `4242 4242 4242 4242` always succeeds. Card `4000 0000 0000 0341` saves
fine but every later charge is declined, which is good for testing failures. Stripe's
test bank accounts are listed in the Stripe docs under ACH testing.

1. Register a test family for a Camp Celebrate week before the early date. The
   confirmation should say **"One last step: choose how you'll pay"**. The dashboard
   should show **Not finished**, and Event Payments should show **Not finished**.
2. Choose **Payment plan**, pick monthly, tick the agreement, and pay the deposit with
   4242. Back on the dashboard you should see the plan, the schedule, the $50-per-person
   discount in the balance, and **Paying by: Plan · Monthly** on Event Payments.
3. **Dry run of the charger** (charges nothing):
   ```
   curl -X POST "https://nnbcxqxwkivadzognpno.supabase.co/functions/v1/charge-payment-plans?dry=1" -H "x-cron-secret: <CRON_SECRET>"
   ```
   On a normal day it lists nothing, because no payment is due yet. To test a real
   charge, set the first installment's `due_on` to today in the Table Editor
   (`payment_installments`), then run the same command without `?dry=1`.
4. Repeat step 2 with card 0341, bring a payment forward as in step 3, and run the
   charger. The family gets a "payment problem" email and the plan shows a retry date.
   After three failures the plan stops and staff get an alert. **Change card or bank
   account** on the dashboard starts it again.
5. Register a second family early and choose **Pay in full**. The amount offered should
   already include the discount, and the balance should end at exactly $0.
6. Register a third and choose **Request a scholarship**. The registration counts as
   finished, with no early discount.

## Worth knowing

- The charger works each amount out **on the day** from what is still owed, divided by
  the charges left. A scholarship or extra payment partway through makes the rest
  smaller, and the last charge lands the balance on $0. The amounts shown in advance
  are estimates.
- Only one charge per plan per day. A failed charge is tried again 3 days later, 3
  tries in all.
- Automatic bank charges use the permission the family gives in Stripe's checkout when
  they save the account. The first off-session **bank** charge in test mode is the
  thing most worth watching: if Stripe asks for more, it will show up as an error on
  that installment.
- Staff never see or type card numbers. Only the family can change the payment method.
- The tests for all of this are in `supabase/tests/`.
